After making the frontend part i started the backend part . I installed the required dependenices and made routes for getting user signed up here is the request
for signup.
(I have shown the schemas already in previous file):


router.post("/", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { name, email, password, picture } = req.body;
    const user = await User.create({ name, email, password, picture });
    res.status(201).json(user);
  } catch (e) {
    let msg;
    if (e.code === 11000) {
      msg = "user already exists";
    } else {
      e.message;
    }
    console.log(e);
    res.status(400).json(msg);
  }
});


This took quite a lot of time, after that i linked my frontend form data to a post request and it worked. The database got new entries. it gave a error if a 
user signed up with email which already existed.
