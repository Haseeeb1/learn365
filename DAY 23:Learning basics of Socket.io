Before knowing about socket.io you should get to know the basics of websockets.
 WebSocket is bidirectional, a full-duplex protocol that is used in the same scenario of client-server communication, unlike HTTP it starts from ws:// or wss://.
 It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will keep alive until it is terminated by either party (client or server). After 
 closing the connection by either of the client and server, the connection is terminated from both ends. 


What is socket.io?
Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.
 
       So in simple words , socket io opens a connection between sender and reciever and allows real time chat.

  The simple answer to this is you will have to refresh your website again and again everytime you have to get new messages.which is not a very handy option.
