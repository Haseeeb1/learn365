The app is almost complete and now styling is left. Although i used react-bootstrap for most of the part but css was still necessary i styled my components
and also fixed some bugs in the api. here is the final App-api

const appApi = createApi({
  reducerPath: "appApi",
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:5001",
  }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    signupUser: builder.mutation({
      query: (user) => ({
        url: "/users",
        method: "POST",
        body: user,
        credentials: "include",
      }),
    }),
    loginUser: builder.mutation({
      query: (user) => ({
        url: "/users/login",
        method: "POST",
        body: user,
        credentials: "include",
      }),
    }),
    logoutUser: builder.mutation({
      query: (payload) => ({
        url: "/logout",
        method: "DELETE",
        body: payload,
        // credentials: "include"
      }),
    }),
  }),
});



other functionality was added thorugh sockets and post/get requests
