Storing the messages,users and all the info in database was task in coding but before that i had to make a pattern on how many models to make,
how to store messages, for e.g( in the user object OR different object for every new message). I had this question in mind from 2 days and i took the complete day 
of today to figure out .
Here's what i planned:
1). A collection for users in which each document will contain info about a user.I decided to make the email element as a unique property as different people can have the
same name, so name could not be unique. Here's my user schema.
{
    name: {
      type: String,
      required: [true, "Can't be blank"],
    },
    email: {
      type: String,
      lowercase: true,
      unique: true,
      required: [true, "Can't be blank"],
      index: true,
      validate: [isEmail, "invalid email"],
    },
    password: {
      type: String,
      required: [true, "Can't be blank"],
    },
    picture: String,
    newMessages: {
      type: Object,
      default: {},
    },
    status: {
      type: String,
      default: "offline",
    },
    tokens: [
      {
        token: {
          type: String,
          required: true,
        },
      },
    ],
  },


2). A collection of messages in which each document will contain a single message info.Here's the message schema.
({
  content: String,
  from: Object,
  socketid: String,
  time: String,
  date: String,
  to: String,
  isFile: false,
});

Why did i add the isFile? I added it to also enable user to send any file as attachment.


3). A collection for groups .Here is the schema
name:{
        unique: true,
        type:String,
       
    },
    createdDate:String,
    createdTime:String,
    Members:[{
       type:String, 
    }],
});
