REACT BOOTSTRAP:
React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without 
unneeded dependencies like jQuery.As one of the oldest React libraries, React-Bootstrap has evolved and grown alongside React, making it
an excellent choice as your UI foundation.
