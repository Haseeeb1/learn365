Redux itself is a standalone library that can be used with any UI layer or framework, including React, Angular, Vue, Ember, and vanilla JS.
Although Redux and React are commonly used together, they are independent of each other.If you are using Redux with any kind of UI framework,
you will normally use a "UI binding" library to tie Redux together with your UI framework, rather than directly interacting with the store
from your UI code.React Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React. If you are using Redux and React together, you should also
use React Redux to bind these two libraries.

You can read the docs on their official website. Here's is a link to a tutorial that will help you understand react-redux better
