After having grabbed some basics of the mern stack it is time to create a project using mern. I researched on some basic projects to do for beginners
and found a chat app listed at most places so i decided to give a go. 
Here are few things i had to solve/learn before starting:

1).Firstly, i had to learn to setup a local mongodb as it is easier to use and i also had to get some practice to use mongoose.

2).Secondly, i had to learn basics of socket io which was necessary to create a real time chat application.

3). Learning react-bootstrap as it is quite a handy tool in creating responsive webpages.

4).Learn to use Font awesome icons.(not necessary).

5).Brainstorming on how many different database models to create and how to store the messages,users etc 

6).figuring out necessary modules to install.


DAY 22:First day:

  I set up my local mongodb. Here's a video on how to do it.  
  
                                              https://youtu.be/FwMwO8pXfq0
  
  A tip: mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/mern-chat-app  
  
   Edit the connection string as 0.0.0.0 before :27017 .In my case the connection string provided by mongodb was without 0.0.0.0 thing which didnt work
